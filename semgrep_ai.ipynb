If it's a \"False Positive\", this array should contain a brief explanation array item. Keep in mind that we have implemented `purifyHTML` and `purifyURL` functions that can be used to sanitize HTML and URLs respectively. Recommend them if applicable. An example of purifyHTML: `import { purifyHTML } from 'app/helpers/purify'; ... dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: purifyHTML(formattedBody) }} ...`. You can enhance their code in the remediation actions for more eye-pleasing output.\n",

    "7. Write a Comment: In the comment field, provide a concise plaintext summary of your analysis. For instance: \"This looks like a True Positive with high confidence because the user-controlled input is passed directly to a SQL query, leading to a potential SQL injection.\" or \"This appears to be a False Positive with high confidence as the variable is hardcoded and not influenced by external input.\"\n",
    "8. Final Output: Ensure your final output is only the JSON object described above. Do NOT include any other text, markdown formatting, or explanations before or after the JSON object. Ignore any empty or irrelevant fields from the initial report.\n",
